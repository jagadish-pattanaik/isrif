## Coding style

### Comments

* Comments documenting the source code are required.

* Comments should be formatted as proper English sentences. Such formatting pays
  attention to, for example, capitalization and punctuation.

### Duplication

* Don't copy-paste source code. Reuse it.

### Formatting

* Line length is limited to 120 characters.

* Sort by alphabetical order in order to make the addition of new entities as
  easy as looking a word up in a dictionary. Otherwise, one risks duplicate
  entries (with conflicting values in the cases of key-value pairs)

### Indentation

* Align `switch` and `case`/`default`. Don't indent the `case`/`default` more
  than its `switch`.

### Naming

* An abstraction should have one name within the project and across multiple
  projects.

* The names of global constants (including ES6 module-global constants) should
  be written in uppercase with underscores to separate words. For example,
  `BACKGROUND_COLOR`.

* The underscore character at the beginning of a name signals that the
  respective variable, function, property is non-public i.e. private, protected,
  or internal. In contrast, the lack of an underscore at the beginning of a name
  signals public API.
